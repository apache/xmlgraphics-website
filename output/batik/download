Title: Download Batik


# Download Batik

There are several ways you can obtain Batik's binary or sources:

 
## Download a distribution

Every Batik release provides three distributions: a binary distribution (named batik-*version*.zip), a source distribution (named batik-src-*version*,zip) and a documentation distribution (named batik-docs-*version*.zip). These distributions are provided as ZIP files on the Apache mirrors. Note that it is good practice to [verify the integrity][1] of the distribution files.

After downloading the distribution, consult the [installation notes][2] for details on how to install.

 
## Current official release (closest mirror site selected automatically)

You are currently using **http://www.bizdirusa.com/mirrors/apache/**. If you encounter a problem with this mirror, then please select another. If all mirrors are failing, there are backup mirrors at the end of the list. See [status][3] of mirrors.

 
The current release is Apache Batik 1.7 (see the [release change log][4]).

Older releases are available from the [Apache archives][20]. However, we strongly recommend using the current release of Batik.

As mentioned in the [installation notes][1], it is important that you verify the release that you download, using either the MD5 hash or verifying the PGP signature against the [PGP key of the developer who signed the release][21].

 
## Current development snapshot

Nightly snapshots of the source tree are available from the [Apache build server][22]. These snapshots represent the current state of development and may or may not be as stable as releases. There are two distributions provided: a complete copy of the Subversion repository trunk (named batik-svn-*date*.zip), including Batik's [regression testing utility][23] and reference images; and a snapshot of the aforementioned source code without any of the testing facilities (named batik-src-*date*.zip).

 
## Subversion repository

To fetch the latest Git repository main, just run the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/xmlgraphics-batik.git

You can also browse the Subversion repository using ViewCVS at .
