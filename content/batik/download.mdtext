## Apache&trade; Batik: Downloading A Distribution
### Binary or Source? {#dist-type}

Most Apache&trade; Batik users will want to download the latest binary distribution, which is ready to run "out of the box." However, a source distribution will be preferable if you fall into one of the following categories:


- You wish to modify Batik.

- You wish to use a version more recent than the latest release. For example, if you have read on the user mailing list that a bug has been fixed or a feature added that you are eager to try, you might download a source distribution from the SVN repository so that you don't have to wait for the next release.

- You wish to build a local copy of the API documentation (javadocs).

### Binary Download {#binary}

Binary distributions include "-bin" in their names, and can be downloaded from a [Batik Distribution mirror](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/batik).

### Source Download {#source}

There are several ways to obtain a source distribution. Please note that they are listed from least current to most current:


- Download a released version from a [Batik Distribution mirror](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/batik). Source distributions include "-src" in their names.

- Download directly from the SVN repository. Anyone can do this using the [Anonymous SVN Server](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/repo.html). By default, the code in SVN is up-to-the-minute, the same code that the developers are modifying.
