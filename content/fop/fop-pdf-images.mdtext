#Apache&trade; FOP: PDF Images Plug-In

## Overview { #overview}

The *fop-pdf-images* plug-in extends FOP in order to add support for using PDF images in fo:external-graphic elements when
generating PDF files. This means one can write something like:

    :::xml
    <fo:external-graphic src="my-doc.pdf#page=1"/>

and

    :::xml
    <fox:external-document src="my-doc.pdf"/>

## Reduce file size

If you input many pdfs together the output pdf has duplicate fonts. Set this flag to merge fonts in fop.xconf:

    :::xml
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">      
      <merge-fonts>true</merge-fonts>
    </renderer>

## Improve performance

If you use many of the same pdf's and they have a large content stream, this flag can improve performance.
The disadvantage will be it can cause higher memory use inside your printer.
Set this flag in fop.xconf:

    :::xml
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">      
      <form-xobject>true</form-xobject>
    </renderer>

## Known issues with Postscript output

- If fonts are not embedded in source PDF:
    - If OTF font type is needed text may be missing if Adobe Reader fonts are not found
    - Text may be rendered wrong or poorly if wrong font is selected as replacement   
- Transparency, layers and opacity may not render correctly
- Gradients in text may be different from the source PDF

## Binary Download { #binary}

If using the binary package, the four jar files should be placed in the *lib* directory of your FOP installation.

Binary distributions include "-bin" in their names, and can be downloaded from a [FOP-PDF-Images Distribution mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop-pdf-images).

Here are the links to each packageâ€™s signature and checksum files. Signatures can be verified by using our [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/KEYS) file.
