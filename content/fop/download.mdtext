#Apache&trade; FOP: Downloading A Distribution


## Binary or Source? {#dist-type}

Most Apache&trade; FOP users will want to download the latest binary distribution, which is ready to run "out of the box." However, a source distribution will be preferable if you fall into one of the following categories:


- You wish to modify FOP.

- You wish to use a version more recent than the latest release. For example, if you have read on the user mailing list that a bug has been fixed or a feature added that you are eager to try, you might download a source distribution from the SVN repository so that you don't have to wait for the next release.

- You wish to build a local copy of the API documentation (javadocs).

## Binary Download {#binary}

Binary distributions include "-bin" in their names, and can be downloaded from a [FOP Distribution mirror](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop). Nightly builds of trunk code can be downloaded here: [Nightly Snapshots](http://ci.apache.org/projects/xmlgraphics/fop/snapshots/).

## Source Download {#source}

There are several ways to obtain a source distribution. Please note that they are listed from least current to most current:


- Download a released version from a [FOP Distribution mirror](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop). Source distributions include "-src" in their names.

- Download a Subversion snapshot [here](http://vc.apache.org/snapshots/fop/). These snapshots are checked out from Subversion approximately every six hours, and have the GMT of their creation time embedded in their names.

- Download directly from the SVN repository. Anyone can do this using the [Anonymous SVN Server](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/repo.html). By default, the code in SVN is up-to-the-minute, the same code that the developers are modifying. See the [SVN section of Developer Tools](dev/tools.html#svn) for more information on using SVN.

With any source distribution, you will need to build FOP from the source files. For details please see the "Build" page on the documentation tab for the version you've downloaded.

## Archive Download {#archives}

FOP Archive distributions are linked from the upper portion of the Apache FOP Download Mirror Page and can be downloaded from the FOP Archives [binaries](http://archive.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/) & [source](http://archive.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/source/) links.
