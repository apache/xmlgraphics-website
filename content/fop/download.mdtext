#Apache&trade; FOP: Downloading A Distribution


## Binary or Source? { #dist-type}

Most Apache&trade; FOP users will want to download the latest binary distribution, which is ready to run "out of the box." However, a source distribution will be preferable if you fall into one of the following categories:


- You wish to modify FOP.

- You wish to use a version more recent than the latest release. For example, if you have read on the user mailing list that a bug has been fixed or a feature added that you are eager to try, you might download a source distribution from the SVN repository so that you don't have to wait for the next release.

- You wish to build a local copy of the API documentation (javadocs).

## Binary Download { #binary}

Binary distributions include "-bin" in their names, and can be downloaded from a [FOP Distribution mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop).

Here are the links to each packageâ€™s signature and checksum files. Signatures can be verified by using our [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/KEYS) file.

## Source Download { #source}

There are several ways to obtain a source distribution. Please note that they are listed from least current to most current:

- Download a released version from a [FOP Distribution mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop). Source distributions include "-src" in their names.

With any source distribution, you will need to build FOP from the source files. For details please see the "Build" page on the documentation tab for the version you've downloaded.

## Archive Download { #archives}

FOP Archive distributions are linked from the upper portion of the Apache FOP Download Mirror Page and can be downloaded from the FOP Archives [binaries](https://archive.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/) & [source](https://archive.apache.org/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/source/) links.
