## Version 1.1 (20 October 2012) { #version_1.1}

### Changes to the Code Base { #Code_1.1}

- ![add](/images/add.jpg) Added support for the role property on fo:page-sequence, fo:flow and fo:static-content. This allows to change the mapping of those FOs to PDF structure types when enabling accessibility. Committed by VH.

    - perform the HashMap check for a failed font inside the synchronized block to avoid a race condition Committed by AD. Thanks to rogov.AT.devexperts.com.

    See issue [FOP-1594](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1594).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Fixed a problem with certain TrueType fonts which are missing the "PCLT" table, where a baseline-shift="sub" had no effect due to a missing x-height value. (Note: This only affects TTFReader, so the font metric file has to be regenerated.) Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: When the base URL was specified as a file system path, the constructed URL was wrong. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Fixed two causes for ClassCastExceptions in BlockContainerLayoutManager. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: padding-top and padding-bottom on list-items could lead to wrong page break decisions and thus to overlapping text. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: The elements representing a non-breaking space weren't always correct. Committed by LF. See issue [FOP-1142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1142).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Text-decoration was not promoted if no text-decoration attribute was specified on a nested element. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1140](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1140).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Spanned cells could lead to an false error message about overlapping cells and ultimately a NullPointerException. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1136](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1136).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Regions with non-standard names got ignored in RTF output leading to missing headers and footers. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) The RTF output now properly generates the "\landscape" flag for documents in landscape orientation. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Following a clarification by the XSL FO SG, space traits are only set on the first and last area generated by an FO, and not on every area anymore. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Floating point numbers were not properly formatted in the PDF renderer which could lead to error messages while opening a PDF in Acrobat Reader. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Spans that end up with a negative height don't get swallowed anymore. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1119](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1119).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Certain border styles could lead to a NullPointerException. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1125](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1125).

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: TableCell did not properly report that it generates reference-areas which could lead to wrong inherited values for start-indent and end-indent. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Image height for BMP images was incorrectly calculated Committed by MM. See issue [FOP-1121](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1121)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Changed a method name in LineArea from finalize to finalise because it was never intended for the method to be an override of the Java Object finalize method. If invoked by the Java garbage collector it may cause a NPE. Committed by MM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Implement property name as default argument on some xsl-function calls. Committed by SP. Thanks to Gerhard Oettl. See issue [FOP-1122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1122)..

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Implement force-page-count property of page-sequence. Committed by SP. Thanks to Gerhard Oettl. See issue [FOP-1120](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1120)..

- ![add](/images/add.jpg) The command-line now automatically sets two parameters for any XSLT transformation: "fop-output-format" contains the MIME type of the currently selected output format, "fop-version" contains FOP's version number. Committed by JM.

- ![add](/images/add.jpg) Added an alternative set of rules for calculating text indents which tries to mimic the behaviour of many commercial FO implementations that chose to break the rules in the FO specification in order to better meet the natural expectations of inexperienced FO users. Committed by JM.

- ![add](/images/add.jpg) font-family list still not fully supported but a comma-separated list is now properly tokenized. FOP will now go through all fonts in the list to find one that is available, but it doesn't do so per character, yet. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Some content inside a table-header may not have been renderered on pages n > 1 in certain conditions. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1109)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Footnotes were lost if the footnote appeared in centered text. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1112](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1112)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Column balancing produced strange break decisions in certain multi-column documents with large amounts of text. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1108](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1108)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: The combination of content-width="scale-to-fit" and content-height="100%" did not work as expected due to a datatype conversion bug. Committed by JM. Thanks to Tom Craddock. See issue [FOP-1107](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1107)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: A span="all" on the first block cause a subsequent page break and the first block didn't span all columns. Committed by JM. See issue [FOP-1106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1106)..

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix: Self-created OutputStreams in PNG Renderer were not properly closed. Committed by JM.

- ![fix](/images/fix.jpg) Bugfix for placement of text inside a text area when borders are present in PostScript output. Committed by JM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Deprecated Fop constructors that use integer constants to select the output format have been removed in favor or the constructors that use MIME types. Committed by JM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Changed the XMLHandler interface so it doesn't report the MIME type it supports but instead can report whether it supports a particular Renderer implementation. XMLHandlers are now configurable. Committed by JM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Improved log and error messages in a number of places by adding additional context information that should make it easier to find the location in the source files. Committed by JM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Additional checks to detect text overflows. The overflow property is now properly handled where applicable. Committed by JM.

- ![update](/images/update.jpg) Source location information improved. If location information is not available, the context information is provided based on text content. Committed by JM.
