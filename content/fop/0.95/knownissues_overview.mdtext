#Apache&trade; FOP: Known Issues


## Known issues { #Known-issues}

This page lists currently known issues in the current release.

For additional information on known issues in Apache&trade; FOP, please have a look at the following pages, too:


-  [the bug list in Jira](../bugs.html)

-  [the task list in the Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/XMLGRAPHICSFOP/FOPProjectTasks)

Apache FOP has an extensive automated testing infrastructure. Parts of this infrastructure are several sets of test cases. When a test case is listed in disabled-testcases.xml it is disabled in the JUnit tests during the normal build process. This indicates a problem in the current codebase. When a bug is fixed or a missing feature is added the entry for the relevant test case(s) are removed.

### FO Tree { #FO-Tree}

This section lists disabled test cases in the test suite for the FO tree tests, at the time of the release.

**from-table-column_marker.fo** (Markers and core function evaluation):

The code currently evaluates this function according to the column in which the marker appears in the source document, rather than the column it is retrieved in.


### Layout Engine { #Layout-Engine}

This section lists disabled test cases in the test suite for the layout engine tests, at the time of the release.

**basic-link_external-destination_2.xml** (External link around an SVG not properly sized):

The bpd trait of the inlineparent area for the basic-link is not sized correctly if it wraps an image that is higher than the nominal line.

**block-container_space-before_space-after_3.xml** (Auto-height block-containers produce fences):

Block-containers with no height currently don't create a fence for spaces as they should (they behave like a normal block).

**block_font-stretch.xml** (font-stretch NYI):

Font-stretch is not implemented, yet.

**block_hyphenation_linefeed_preserve.xml** (Hyphenation with preserved linefeeds):

When hyphenation is enabled and linefeeds are preserved, the text is output multiple times.

**block_linefeed-treatment.xml** (linefeed-treatment):

Preserved linefeeds in a fo:character are not handled correctly.

**block_white-space-treatment_3.xml** (white-space-treatment):

White space handling incorrectly stops at fo:inline boundaries when it comes to formatter generated line breaks.

**block_space-before_space-after_8.xml** (Empty blocks produce fences):

An empty block currently produces a fence for stacking constraints which it shouldn't.

**block_white-space_nbsp_2.xml** (block white-space nbsp 2):

The nbsp given as an fo:character is not adjustable and therefore the justification does not work in this case.

**block_word-spacing.xml** (block word-spacing):

Word-spacing may not work as expected.

**block_word-spacing_text-align_justify.xml** (block word-spacing text-align justify):

Word-spacing may not work as expected.

**external-graphic_oversized.xml** (external-graphic don't shrink):

Images currently don't shrink so they fit on a page when they are too big and shrinking is allowed to happen (min/opt/max).

**external-graphic_src_uri.xml** (Test case with HTTP URL):

Doesn't work behind a proxy which requires authorization.

**footnote_space-resolution.xml** (Space Resolution in foot note area):

Space resolution does not work between footnote regions.

**footnote_in_list.xml** (Footnotes swallowed in lists):

Element lists for lists are created by combining the element lists from list-item-label and list-item-body. The footnotes contained in the KnuthBlockBoxes are not propagated to the combined element list.

See also: [FOP-1099](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1099)

**footnote_in_table.xml** (Footnotes swallowed in tables):

Element lists for tables are created by combining the element lists from the individual table-cells. The footnotes contained in the KnuthBlockBoxes are not propagated to the combined element list.

See also: [FOP-1099](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-1099)

**inline_block_nested_3.xml** (NPE for table inside an inline):

Placing a table as a child of an fo:inline produces a NullPointerException.

**inline-container_block_nested.xml** (inline-container is not implemented, yet.):

inline-container is not implemented, yet. Content of an inline-container will get swallowed. The test case contains no checks.

**inline-container_border_padding.xml** (inline-container is not implemented, yet.):

inline-container is not implemented, yet. Content of an inline-container will get swallowed.

**inline_letter-spacing.xml** (inline letter-spacing):

Letter-spacing may not work as expected within fo:inline.

**inline_word-spacing.xml** (inline word-spacing):

Word-spacing may not work as expected within fo:inline.

**inline_word-spacing_text-align_justify.xml** (inline word-spacing text-align justify):

 *TODO: Add missing description in disabled-testcases.xml!*

**leader-alignment.xml** (leader-alignment NYI):

Leader-alignment is not yet implemented.

**leader_leader-pattern_use-content_bug.xml** (leader-pattern="use-content": Problem with line height):

Line height is not correctly calculated for use-content leaders whose height is larger than the rest of the line.

See also: [http://www.nabble.com/leaders-with-leader-pattern%3D%22use-content%22-t546244.html](http://www.nabble.com/leaders-with-leader-pattern%3D%22use-content%22-t546244.html)

**list-block_keep-with-previous.xml** (keep-with-previous doesn't work in lists):

Keep-with-previous doesn't work inside tables and lists, yet.

**list-item_block_keep-with-previous.xml** (keep-with-previous doesn't work in lists):

Keep-with-previous doesn't work inside tables and lists, yet.

**page-breaking_4.xml** (Page breaking doesn't deal with IPD changes):

Page breaking currently doesn't support changing available IPD between pages of a single page-sequence. Element list generation has to be reset to redetermine line breaks in this case.

**page-breaking_6.xml** (Overflow handing is incomplete):

Line breaking is not 100% correct when there's too little space. Overflows are not detected and warned.

**page-height_indefinite_simple.xml** (Indefinite page height handling is imcomplete):

A RuntimeException is thrown for a page of indefinite height. Lots of warnings.

**page-number-citation_background-image.xml** (page-number-citation: Problem with background-image):

Background-images on page-number-citations are not placed correctly.

**page-number-citation-last_basic.xml** (page-number-citation-last: FOs spanning multiple pages are not properly handled.):

Resolution of forward references does not wait until an FO is fully finished when an FO spans multiple pages.

**page-number-citation_complex_1.xml** (IDs are not working on all FO elements):

The "id" attributes are not properly handled for all block-level FO elements.

**page-number-citation_complex_2.xml** (IDs are not working on all FO elements):

The "id" attributes are not properly handled for all inline-level FO elements.

**region-body_column-count_footnote.xml** (Footnotes in multi-column documents):

Footnotes may overlap with text of the region-body in multi-column documents.

**region-body_column-count_balance_4col.xml** (Column Balancing problems):

Situation in a 4-column document where the column balancing doesn't work and even causes some content to disappear.

**region-body_column-count_bug36356.xml** (Column Balancing problems):

Column balancing doesn't work as expected.

**table-cell_empty_area_with_marker.xml** (table-cell empty area with marker.xml):

A table-cell producing an empty area does currently not add any markers to a page. See TODO entry in AreaAdditionUtil.

**table_border-width_conditionality.xml** (Border conditionality on table):

The code should be ok, but the test case uses shorthands and therefore is probably not expressing the indended outcome according to the spec. The test case should be revisited.

**wrapper_block_id.xml** (fo:wrapper around block-level content (with id)):

"id" attributes on fo:wrapper around block-level content don't get added to the area tree.

**block_shy_linebreaking_hyph.xml** (Soft hyphen with normal hyphenation enabled):

A soft hyphen should be a preferred as break compared to a normal hyphenation point but is not.
