#Apache&trade; FOP Design: Startup, Environment, Control


## Introduction { #intro}

Startup is the process of getting Apache&trade; FOP bootstrapped and creating basic objects. Environment includes acquiring user options, instantiating any frameworks, setting up logging, etc. Control includes the basic logic for tieing the various subsystems together properly.

## Status { #status}

### To Do { #status-todo}


- avalon integration - logging, configuration, component management, caching, uri resolver

### Work In Progress { #status-wip}

### Completed { #status-complete}
