## Unreported Issues (Reporting New Issues) {#issues_new}

User reports of bugs and requests for enhancements are extremely important parts of XML Graphics Commons development, and we appreciate the time you take to help us track these issues down.


- Review the [Apache Bug Writing Guidelines](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) before submitting your report.

- Enter a new issue report at the [XML Graphics Commons issue database (Bugzilla)](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=XMLGraphicsCommons). You will be asked to login to an existing Bugzilla account or to create a new one. When entering the bug report, please make your description complete and concise. If appropriate, attach a minimal fo file to your report which demonstrates the problem.

- After submission, a copy of your bug report will be automatically sent to the [XML Graphics General discussion list](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/mail.html#xmlgraphics-general).
