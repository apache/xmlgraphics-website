Title: Apache(tm) XML Graphics Commons

#Apache&trade; XML Graphics Commons


## Overview { #Overview}

Apache&trade; XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several reusable components used by [Apache Batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) and [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/). Many of these components can easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO. You will find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, Graphics2D implementations that let you generate PDF & PostScript files, and much more.

The Apache&trade; XML Graphics Commons project is part of the [Apache&trade;](https://www.apache.org) Software Foundation, which is a wider community of users and developers of open source projects.

In the Wiki, we have a [Roadmap for Apache XML Graphics Commons](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/xmlgraphics/XmlGraphicsCommonComponents). This roadmap is the place to describe new ideas for the project.

## Features { #features}

Components which have been ported from [Apache Batik](/batik/) and [Apache FOP](/fop/) include:
