xmlgraphics.apache.org - Apache XML Graphics Project
# Welcome to the Apache XML Graphics Project

The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software licensed to the Apache Software Foundation intended for the creation & maintenance of:

- the conversion of XML formats to graphical output
- the conversion of XML formats to graphical output

# Apache XML Graphics Project - Current Projects

The Apache XML Graphics Project currently consists of the following sub-projects, each focused on a different aspect of XML Graphics:

- [Apache Batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) - A toolkit for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), based in Java
- [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) - A print formatter & renderer for XSL-FO (FO=formatting objects), based in Java
- [Apache XML Graphics Commons](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/commons/) - A library with various components used by Apache Batik and Apache FOP, written in Java

## Apache Batik: a Java-based SVG toolkit

Batik is a Java(tm) technology based toolkit for applications or applets that want to use images in the [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) format for various purposes, such as viewing, generation or manipulation.

The project's ambition is to give developers a set of [core modules](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/architecture.html#coreComponents) which can be used together or individually to support specific SVG solutions. Examples of [modules](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/architecture.html) include:

- the [SVG Parser](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/architecture.html#lowLevelComponents)
- the [SVG Generator](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/svggen.html)
- the [SVG DOM](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/domapi.html)

Another ambition for the Batik project is to make it highly [extensible](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/extendingBatik.html) (for example, Batik allows the developer to handle custom SVG tags). Even though the goal of the project is to provide a set of core modules, one of the deliverables is a full fledged [SVG Browser](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/svgviewer.html) implementation, which validates the various modules and their inter-operability.
