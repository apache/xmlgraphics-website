## Access the Source Tree <a id="Access+the+Source+Tree"></a>

So, you've decided that you need access to the source tree to see the latest and greatest code. There're two different forms of SVN access. The first is `anonymous` and anybody can use it. The second requires that you have a login to the development server. If you don't know what this means, join the mailing list and find out.

### Anonymous (read-only) SVN access <a id="Anonymous+%28read-only%29+SVN+access"></a>

Anyone can checkout source code from our anonymous SVN server. To do so, simply use the following commands (if you are using a GUI SVN client, configure it appropriately):

For **Apache Batik**:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/trunk
For **Apache FOP**:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/fop/trunk
For **Apache XML Graphics Commons**:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/commons/trunk
For **Apache XML Graphics website**:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/site
You can find additional information for setting up SVN access on the [Version Control FAQ](http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html).
Committers need to replace " `http` " with " `https` " and then log in so they can gain write access!
